# CoreData-CRUD-Swift-5.0-iOS-example

[Swift 5.0](https://swift.org) - A (very simple) example project that exposes the usage of CoreData to create entities and to persist to a SQLite Datastore.

This app demonstrates Core Data and persistent storage, by reading Event data from both, locally and remotely retrieved [JSON file /  response](https://github.com/jongensvantechniek/CoreData-CRUD-Swift-5.0-example/blob/master/CoreDataCRUD/events.json), creates and stores those Events in a SQLite datastore. It is possible to do single and batch updates, deletions, retrieving and filtering on stored Events.

*Note*: If you are considering to use Core Data in an app meant for production, it is worth to investigate [Realm](https://realm.io), which is a mobile platform and a replacement for SQLite & Core Data, for both Android & iOS.

## Prerequisites

* [Xcode 10.2.+ - Swift 5.0](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)
* [iOS9 / iOS10 / iOS11 / iOS12](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)
* [SQLite browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org)

### iOS

Tested on:

- iOS9
- iOS10
- iOS11
- iOS12

### iPhone

Tested on:

- iPhone 6
- iPhone 6s
- iPhone 7
- iPhone 8
- iPhone Xr

## The objective

for this project is to learn to:

- Use Core Data to create Entities and to persist Entities to a SQLite datastore

- Help others understand and use Core Data with simple, yet concrete examples,
  on the usage of Core Data and persistent store

### location of SQLite database

In order to inspect persisted events you can use for example a SQLite database browser to view persisted entries: https://sqlitebrowser.org

The actual path of the SQLite database file will be shown in the Xcode console logger. For example:

`/Users/<name>/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/<device-uuid>/data/Containers/Data/Application/<application-uuid>/Documents`

1. Select and copy the path that is logged in the Xcode Console (In XCode -> View -> Debug Area -> Activate Console) to SQLite database file.

2. Go to MacOS Finder, press:`SHIFT + CMD + G` and paste the logged path to the SQLite database file and click: `OK`

3. Finally open the SQLite database file with, for example: [SQLite browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org)

Note: this example project is non-exhaustive.

## Model

A model represents the entity that can be used to store in the datastore.
The [Event](https://github.com/jongensvantechniek/CoreData-CRUD-Swift-5.0-example/blob/master/CoreDataCRUD/Event.swift) Entity/ Model has the following model attributes:

	class Event: NSManagedObject {
	    @NSManaged var title: String
	    @NSManaged var date: NSDate
	    @NSManaged var venue: String
	    @NSManaged var city: String
	    @NSManaged var country: String
	    @NSManaged var attendees: AnyObject
	    @NSManaged var fb_url: AnyObject
	    @NSManaged var ticket_url: AnyObject
	    @NSManaged var eventId: String
	}

The AnyObject type in this example are [non-standard persistent attributes](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/LifeofaManagedObject.html) that are not supported directly in Core Data. The AnyObject, as the name suggests, can therefore be for example: an `Array` or `NSURL`, or any other objecttype.

### [Core Data API](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001075-CH2-SW1)

This application utilises the Core Data stack concurrently
to locally persist data. Below you will find an overview of: how the Core Data stack is implemented and utilised within the application.

#### Thread confinement

You can see that there are three layers used, this is to provide true concurrency and also utilise thread confinement.

The `minions* workers` are the workers in the `EventAPI` that save each `parsed` and prepared `NSManagedObject` within it's own Thread. Eventually when all NSManagedObjects are stored within the thread confined context, the `EventAPI` calls the `MainContext` via the `PersistenceManager`, which in turn will call `ContextManager` and cause the `minions` to merge / synchronize with the MainContext and and with the `Master application context`, which finally calls the `DataStore Coordinator` to actually store the NSManagedObjects to the datastore.

#### Event API

The [Event API](https://github.com/jongensvantechniek/CoreData-CRUD-Swift-3.1-example/blob/master/CoreDataCRUD/EventAPI.swift)
is the interface where a view controller directly communicates to. The Event API exposes several endpoints to a view controller to Create, Read, Update, Delete Events.

Open up Xcode, and open the project, and open the `EventAPI.swift` file.
Then click on `^6`, thus `control + 6`, this will open up an overview of several CRUD methods used, and click on the method of interest, to see it's implementation.
